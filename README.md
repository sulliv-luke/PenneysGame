# Penneys Game Simulation Study

This repository contains files for a java program I wrote to help me solve the following problem for STU22005 Applied Probability Project:

Consider a coin tossing game between two players. The first player picks a combination of heads
(H) and tails (T) of length 3 (e.g. HHH, HTH) that they think will come up. The second player
subsequently picks a different combination of heads and tails of the same length. The coin is
then flipped continuously until a player completes their combination of heads and tails. For each
of the 8 combinations player 1 picks (i.e. HHH, HTH, HHT, etc.), which combinations should
player 2 pick to maximize the chance of winning? For each of the 8 combinations player 1 picks,
estimate the chance of winning for player 2 using the optimal strategy.
